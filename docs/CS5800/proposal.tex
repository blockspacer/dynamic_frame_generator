\begin{abstract}
Here is proposed a study of scene semantics
using ray tracing and current rendering techologies.
Not only the relationships of objects to each other important,
but the relationship of objects to the rendered frame.
This research will be applied to a broader machine learning
architecture for dynamically generating frames
given scene and render data.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The generation of training data is essential
for the application of machine learning.
One such data to be generated are semantics of a 3D scene,
the description of the scene and its complexity.
Knowing scene semantics at rendertime is key to understanding and perhaps improving the render
pipeline.
The principles behind rendering a scene is fundamental to the
render pipeline, however
extracting this process into non-graphical sematic data is not as straightforward.
Ultimately the inputs of machine learning algorithms must be in the format of vector of values.
It is therefore important to study not only how scene semantics,
but also how to store them in easily understood formats for later machine learning development.
This document is a proposal for the study of scene semantics, ray tracing, and the development of a
usable algorithm to generate usable semantic data from 3D environments.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

\subsection{Ray Tracing}
Ray tracing is the study of how light behaves in a given environment.
Figure \ref{fig:raytrace} from \cite{backwards_raytrace}
shows a ray tracing problem studied in 1986, where light rays are mapped from
the viewer to a light source. Avro \textit{et al.}
\cite{backwards_raytrace} discuss the difficulty of this problem,
as it involves taking into consideration material properties, light sources,
and where the view is looking.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Example of a problem in ray tracing \cite{backwards_raytrace}.}
\label{fig:raytrace}
\end{figure}

Technological advancements have greatly improved ray tracing capabilities.
The ray tracing basics described by Scratchapixel \cite{raytrace_walkthrough}
provides a walkthrough with code samples for casting rays from the camera.

\subsection{Rendering Technologies}
Two renderers that are now highly developed are the Arnold Renderer \cite{arnold}
and the RenderMan renderer \cite{renderman}. Each of these renderers
function differently.
RenderMan was chosen to be the renderer software for the purposes of this project,
since it is arguably the most advanced renderer under development to date.

\section{Proposed Work}
\label{sec:proposed_work}
\subsection{Architectural Overview}
\label{subsec:architecture}
The foundation of this work is based off of Ma \textit{et al.} \cite{pose_guided_image_generation}.
Their research showed that a 2-stage generator-discriminator architecture worked well for generating
and refining images from one pose to another.
See Figure \ref{fig:block_diagram} for a basic block diagram of the adapted architecture
proposed for this project.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=8cm]{block_diagram.png}}
\caption{Block diagram for proposed architecture.}
\label{fig:block_diagram}
\end{figure}

The most important component to the architecture as a whole
is Generator I, which uses a combination of machine learning models to generate a
low resolution image containing global structures found in the
source data. As discussed previously, the semantic data must be extracted from
the scene in order to use as input into this machine learning model.
The focus of this proposed project is to generate these semantics and study
what other information is important when considering the
``meaning'' behind a 3D scene.

\subsection{Development and Expectations}
Most of the development for this project will be in RenderMan and Autodesk Maya,
with some pre/post-processing to occur intermittently in Python.

\subsubsection{RenderMan}
RenderMan will be used to build a render pipeline that will not only render advanced images
of 3D scenes, but also calculate and export scene semantics.
It is predicted that this will be possible throught he use of raytracing or ray sampling.
The walkthrough comparison of OpenGL to RenderMan found in \cite{renderman_opengl}
may prove useful for development.
It is also expected that the RenderMan documentation found in \cite{renderman_docs}
will be referred to as well.

\subsubsection{Autodesk Maya}
Autodesk Maya (Maya for short) is a 3D animation and modeling software that will be utilized
for creating the 3D scenes to use as input to the render pipeline.
The scenes created will be of varying complexity to ensure that all aspects of a
render will be taken into account. May Embedded Language (MEL) or Python scripting
will be utilized within Maya in order to produce some semantic data, such as neighboring
objects and tree heirarchy. The export functions (OBJ, FBX, etc.) will also be explored
as sources of further semantic data that can be preprocessed from the scene.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Here is proposed a project to benefit ongoing research in the field of Computer Graphics.
Not only will the project development benefit my thesis work, but it is also a study of
generating semantic data from 3D scenes. Many of these data are easily recognizable to humans,
however automating the process is a complicated task that will involve much consideration over
scene dynamics and the relationship of objects to what is rendered. Ray tracing is also a concept
key to many other computational tasks in Computer Graphics, and through working on this
project I will be able to explore the implementation of ray tracing and its application
to difficult problems.
