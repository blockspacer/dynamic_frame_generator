\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Rendering full-length feature films is burdensome for current technologies.
Rendering a single frame of an animation is highly dependent upon the rendering software
and scene complexity,
but for the most part the rendering process is completely dependent upon the renderer.
There are no shortcuts to be made.

This research is focused on studying how to generate renderings for animations using
Machine Learning.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was first proposed by
\cite{generative_adversarial_networks}
as a way to
train a model to produce more realistic images. The network is made up of two architectures:
a generator, G, and a disciminator, D.

The Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) was first proposed by
\cite{unsupervised_learning}. The architecture is similar to a GAN,
but uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in D and G, respectively.

\section{Proposed Work}
\label{sec:proposed_work}
Foundational example DCGAN repository titled ``Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks''
, created by Pytorch \cite{dcgan_git}. This repository is explained in a walkthrough
by Pytorch \cite{dcgan_example}.

\subsection{Dataset Creation}
\label{subsec:data}
Create a dataset of 10,000 32 x 32 pixel images based off of previous research.
Images are blurred and small anomolies are added.
The original images are kept to form an image pair with the altered images.

\caption{Example of input (left) and expected output (right).}
\label{fig:training_pair}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Construction}
\label{subsec:model}

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:methods/evaluation}
The architecture will be evaluated on how well it is able to learn how to
enhance an altered image. After optimization and training has taken place,
an unknown altered image will be input into the algorithm, and the output
will be compared to the original, unaltered image.
